## Introduction
OmniBTC Risk Fund is a protective measure designed to safeguard users when conducting transactions on the OmniBTC platform. The fund aims to provide compensation for abnormal transactions and other potential losses that users may experience. Additionally, when issuing tokens on OmniBTC, 10% of the tokens are allocated to the Risk Fund to ensure adequate resources for compensation.

## Objective
The primary objective of the OmniBTC Risk Fund is to ensure a secure and transparent trading experience for all users on the platform. The fund serves as a safety net, compensating users in the event of unforeseen issues or losses related to their transactions.

## Fund Allocation
A percentage of the transaction fees generated on the OmniBTC platform is allocated to the Risk Fund. Moreover, when tokens are issued on the platform, 10% of the tokens are reserved for the Risk Fund. This dual allocation mechanism ensures that the fund has adequate resources to compensate users in case of abnormal transactions or other losses.

Please note that the final decision on compensation eligibility and the compensation amount lies solely with the OmniBTC team.
